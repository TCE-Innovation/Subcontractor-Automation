# The Three Forms
This process involves 3 Plumsail Forms:

1. [Initialization Form]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/threeForms/initializationForm.md %})
2. [Subcontractor Form]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/threeForms/subcontractorForm.md %})
3. [Correction Form]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/threeForms/correctionForm.md %})

All forms employ the same formatting restrictions, the rules for which can be found in [Formatting]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/formatting.md %}).

The initialization form kickstarts the process with a little bit of known good information from the general contractor.

The subcontractor form contains a bulk of the questions, and falls upon the subcontractor to complete.

The correction form is used just in case the subcontractor has messed up content, as that is something we can't check for. We can only verify formatting in the subcontractor forms.
